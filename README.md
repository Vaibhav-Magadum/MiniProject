## Introduction

The number of vehicles on the road is increasing day by day, making it crucial to manage traffic flow efficiently to utilize existing road capacity effectively. This project focuses on developing a smart traffic management system that optimizes traffic flow, reduces congestion, and minimizes travel time using AI-based techniques.

## Motivation

Traffic congestion has wide-ranging negative impacts on cities, including economic losses, increased travel times, environmental pollution, and decreased quality of life. This project's motivation is to address these issues by implementing effective traffic management strategies using AI-powered traffic light control.

## Problem Definition

The problem at hand is to design and implement a solution that effectively reduces traffic congestion. The solution aims to minimize congestion-related delays, improve travel times, reduce environmental impact, and enhance overall urban mobility.

## Objectives

- Develop an AI-based traffic light controller that adapts to current traffic situations.
- Optimize traffic management to reduce bottlenecks and ensure smoother coordination between transportation modes.
- Increase safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers through improved road conditions.

## Methodology

The project employs the following key methodologies:

1. **Detection**: Real-time vehicle detection using computer vision techniques.
2. **Tracking**: Tracking detected vehicles across frames to monitor traffic flow.
3. **Adaptive Control**: Adjusting traffic signal timings based on current traffic density.
4. **Arduino Integration**: Connecting the control algorithm with physical traffic lights using Arduino.

## Components

The project involves the following components:

- Arduino UNO R3
- Breadboard
- LED Lights (Red, Yellow, Green)
- Jumper Wires
- Webcam
- Arduino USB Cable

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries and dependencies mentioned in the documentation.
2. Run the object detection and tracking code using OpenCV and YOLO.
3. Integrate the detection and tracking results with the Arduino-based traffic light control.
4. Deploy the solution at traffic junctions with webcams for real-time traffic data.

## Results

The project's expected outcomes include:

- Improved traffic flow and reduced congestion.
- Reduced travel time and enhanced efficiency for commuters.
- Safer road conditions through better-coordinated traffic lights.
- Application of cutting-edge technologies to traffic management.
